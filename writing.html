      <h2>My Grievance<h2>
       <p id="writing">
“Why did I choose this school?” was the question rushing through my head as I cruised through the walls of Stuyvesant during orientation. I was late and half-awake after partying hard at 8th Grade prom in jeans and a t-shirt. I was taken to a math room to meet my homeroom by Big Sibs I had asked for help. There I was immediately tasked with a math test. I didn’t even have time to breathe.
This first encounter embodies what Stuyvesant has felt like to me for the past couple of years: a lot of questioning, insecurity, feeling out of place, lack of sleep, and STRESS!
I didn’t know what I signed up for before coming here. I, unlike most Stuy kids, was unaware of the reputation this school held, for better or for worse. I chose this school simply because of a conversation I overheard in Algebra and pictures I had seen of the building. In my eyes, Stuyvesant was a beacon of hope compared to the crappy experiences I had prior.
Middle school wasn’t the best. I felt like an outcast. I hoped Stuy would remedy this problem since it would be a new school, in a new borough, and with different people. Not only this, but I held the belief that, because I would be forced into discomfort, I’d grow from it. I also held the belief that I wouldn’t be on the same path fated for Hispanics from my neighborhood that went to the local high school: becoming a dropout.
Stuy and I have had a tango with a couple of missteps and trembles followed by promenades, turns, and a step close. I’ve lost several things, both literally and metaphorically, over my time here. My innocence, water bottles, and strong connection to my Salvadoran roots are in the past. New things have also come into my life, such as the Hispanic and Black friends I’ve made inside and outside of Stuy, a sense of grit, and renewed frustration. The best song to describe this feeling inside of me as I write this is “We didn’t start the fire.” I’m furious thinking about racial incidents that I have seen take place at Stuy. I am fed up with seeing a fellow student in blackface, name calling, and seeing the word “spic” in the Dear Incoming groups. This is the Stuy I have lived through and that the majority of students and staff members are aware of yet ignore because they can. I cannot.
I came into this school optimistically and I am leaving with an anger I haven’t felt in years. My purpose with this assignment is to inform all of my readers of my life experiences in and out of Stuy while I vent and say the words I have withheld with restraint. I don’t care if it makes you uncomfortable. I won’t stop because you want me to. This is my story and I WILL NOT commodify it for you nor the English department/Stuyvesant.
Anyways, let’s hear my #StuywhileBrown story before it gets taken down since this school loves to silence my voice.

        <h2>再见<h2>
       <p id="writing">
I'm thinking of you again,
the country that is breaking apart at the seams.
I would be at your doorstep
if only I could.

I don’t where I am going

Your beauty I miss so much
and the color of your sky.
The sunrise and the sunset
and watching days go by.

How often I cried for you
when things were going tough.
I know when you are happy
and when you've had enough.

No matter that we're apart.
I am still as close to you
as I was once before.
The country I call home

I know we have to part for now
I am left at the gate in tears 
While I am 50,000 ft in the air I think…
of the days going by 

When will we see each other again?

After my long restless nap, 
I awaken to a lazy city of smoke and relaxation
The elderly play their games of mahjong while the pandas yawn from a long day 
This feels like home.

It reminds me of the elderly women who would gather that run down McDonald’s and just talk 
This city is just as smoky and busy as the clamoring streets I remember 
No matter that we’re apart,
I am still close to you 
I can’t seem to get away 

We have had some great times and our memories I will treasure.

So long Flushing

       <h2>Mi Cultura<h2>
       <p id="writing">
I am sitting at my desk right now ready to write my story. I’m a person who was born at the crossroads of cultures. I wake up to Saturday mornings filled with the sound of cumbias. My Saturday afternoons are packed with foodie adventures as I eat hot pot and drink bubble tea with friends in my hometown of Flushing. I was raised as a Salvadoran-American surrounded by Asian culture, which meant I was constantly learning new things about myself and my community.  For instance, I learned how to make rice balls as my friends, Tyrone and Wentao, and I worked together to make them for Japanese class. I was the weakest link in the group as I could barely shape the balls correctly, needing guidance from Wentao. After an hour of laughter and failed attempts, we ended up making 10 rice balls per person, each one of us stuffing ours with a unique filling. I opted to make mine Salvadoran in flavor using leftover chicharrón while Tyrone used fried chicken and Wentao used nothing. I’ll admit that it was a cheap move to use chicharrón as I didn’t have to buy it; however, it was strangely the right move. I felt like that chicharrón rice ball as I navigated the world knowing more about Chinese poker and how to order dim sum than Selena or mangú. When I was younger, I sometimes felt alienated as I didn’t feel Hispanic enough. I was never the dancer who swept the dancefloor to bachata or the devout soccer player who could make a goal with his eyes closed. I’m instead Bryan: a kid who is constantly cooking Asian dishes at home while listening to Arashi, a Japanese boy band, behind closed doors. I tried to cling to my Latinidad by fulfilling stereotypes as I thought that is what made a Latino a Latino. I maintained a machista demeanor, a mask that I hope would hide my insecurities. It wasn’t until I navigated FLAMA, a youtube channel, on the search for videos by my favorite comedian that I encountered something that made me feel visible. My hands clenched as I watched the video Enough of Not Being Latino Enough... I'm Sorry Con Excuse Me since Carlos being scolded for “not being Latino” after declining to dance was something I had gone through. Carlos’s rant struck me as I realized I didn’t have to be accepted to be Latino because me being Latino is a matter of fact. What I’ve learned through my life is people should be unafraid of exploring cultures. My community allowed me to be more culturally aware as I indulged in dim sum and JPOP. This may make me a peculiar Latino to some but that’s because my Latinidad goes the confines of my Salvadoran roots. I say this to remind anyone reading this that being accepting of foreign cultures doesn’t make us strange but instead is truly what helps us grow as people. 
	Thank you for your time.

       <h2>The Light<h2>
       <p id="writing">
The world was changing before my eyes 
I felt the bitter cold yet at the same time the warmth of the world
My country was full of the smell of gunpowder and the incessant sounds of bombs painting the sky
The flame of the battle grew without a stop in sight
The moment that flame intensified I was forced to leave my beloved home

All the departure brought was a trail of despair and darkness 
I was forced to adjust to a new environment that was full of the sound of many souls yearning for peace
But at least there is a ray of light on the other side
A light I call hope
This light showed me my new ‘home’
I joyously chirped the words of my abuela, De ilusión tambiėn se vive
However, after spending time here, it seemed like my destiny was already written in stone
My spirit was left broken in the face of fear and loneliness
I was to become another mule of society, gruelingly working in places unknown 
Unknown to all except us, the immigrants 
It seemed like the world was a scratched disc repeating the same tune

But that wasn’t the case 
All this worry pulled me towards the wise words of my abuela
I felt a wave of tranquility brush over my fears as I feebly clung to the past
At this moment, I discovered a new destiny, a new story where I would be happy
I was given a renewed sense of warmth from many along my new path 
It made my journey worthwhile

I was trusted with helping put smiles on children 
The smiles that I never got to have at such an age
This is something that I love to do with a passion
It lets me tell stories that seem to be a fragment of a deceptive reality
These stories let me become ‘The Light’ for them; it helps me change them just like the Light did with me
 The light on the other side was my strength when I was young and sorrowful
 The light inspired me
 The light is the same light that shone on the lives of the great
 It is the light of hope for me and for many others.
